The **Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG)** workflow aims at integrating experimental LC-MS/MS DDA metabolomics data into a Wikidata-connected knowledge graph. To allow for iterative addition of samples over time, data from each sample is processed individually.

Data are processed in different independent modules (for molecular networking, structural annotations, etc.) before being formatted as interoperable sample specific RDF knowledge graphs.

We recommend you to start with [enpkg_workflow](https://github.com/enpkg/enpkg_workflow) for an overview of the processing and links to the different modules.

If you use it, please cite TO COME in addition of the different tools specific papers.
